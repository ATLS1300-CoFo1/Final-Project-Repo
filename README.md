# Final-Project-Repo
start code and examples to get you to the finish line!

If the file has the word "func" in it, it is JUST a function. There is example code beneath that can be uncommented to see how it works, but you should be able to clean its function from looking the code.

**Boundary.py** is a module. Download it (green button), put it in the same folder as your script and import it with
`import boundary`
Example code is provided in the file.

**list_examples.py** shows 
1. how to make a list of turtles with a for loop
2. how to access the list using a for loop with i (indexing)
3. how to access the list using a for loop with turt (individual turtles)
