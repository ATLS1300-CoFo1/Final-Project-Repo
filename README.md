# Final-Project-Repo
Start code and examples to get you to the finish line!

If the file has the word "func" in it, it is JUST a function. There is example code beneath that can be uncommented to see how it works, but you should be able to clean its function from looking the code.

**Boundary.py** is a module. Download it (green button), put it in the same folder as your script and import it with
`import boundary`
Example code is provided in the file.

**list_examples.py** shows 
1. how to make a list of turtles with a for loop
2. how to access the list using a for loop with i (indexing)
3. how to access the list using a for loop with turt (individual turtles)
4. how to access a list using modulo (indexing 2 different length lists in a for loop)

**There are two start code scripts available** 
OOP_Start.py describes how to set up using classes and object (like defining and calling functions)
Game_Start.py describes how to set up a procedural game. Has location for classes and objects, too.
_(You're gonna want to make sure you follow organization similar as to what's in here.)_

**Gallery viewer** is missing. Will provide later.

Email if you need more examples!
